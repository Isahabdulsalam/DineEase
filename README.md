## Introduction

Welcome to our Restaurant Website project! This is the final portfolio project for the ALX program, where we created a fully functional and responsive website for a restaurant using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Team Members

- Isah Abdulsalam (Software Developer)

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide an online presence for the restaurant, showcasing its menu, services, and other essential information to attract and retain customers.

## Target Audience

This project was created for restaurant owners and customers who want an easy and engaging way to interact with the restaurant online.

## Personal Focus

My personal focus was on building a user-friendly and visually appealing website that provides all necessary information about the restaurant in an accessible and responsive manner.

## About Us

## Technologies Used

For the front end, we chose to use HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript without any additional frameworks. This decision was made to solidify our understanding of these core technologies.

## Challenges

### Technical Challenge

One of the most difficult technical challenges was ensuring the website's responsiveness across different devices. By using media queries and flexible grid layouts, we successfully made the website look good on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

### Non-Technical Challenge

Coordinating the design and content layout to provide a seamless user experience was a significant non-technical challenge. We had to iterate through several designs and gather feedback to finalize the layout.
